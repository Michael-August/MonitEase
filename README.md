# MonitEase

### Description
This application is a mini inventory application which maybe made a full inventory app along the line. This application helps you;
1. Know how many of each stock is remaining.
2. Keep track of your daily sales.
3. Generate Reports or account on a given duration (Daily, weekly etc).
4. Push email when an item reaches restock level.
5. Search of filter by series of conditions (item name, Date sold, have Paid etc).

### Motivation for the Project.
Sometime in 2020, I worked in computer repairs shop, all the records were written on books which makes it difficult to generate accounts at the end of the 
day for days when work end late. With this application, everybody can go home without waiting for account and just generate it from this application.
It happened that the secretary wanted to resign, we had to go through the book from the day the secretary was employed to calculate all the item given to her 
and verify that it matches with what she was leaving behind. 

### Technology
This project is built with Django python rest framework.
Posgrsql Database.
